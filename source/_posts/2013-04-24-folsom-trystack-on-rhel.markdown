目前已经有很多人加入了，有3627等待加入，估计很难加进去了

以下是原文

>    Hi TryStack Users
>   
>    Please take my apologies for delaying deploy x86 Zones.
>   We are happy to announce new Folsom X86 zone.
>   
>    http://trystack.org/
>   http://x86.trystack.org/dashboard/
>   
>    One great news is Red Hat's starts contributing,
>   The cluster is now managed by Redhat and it is running on RHEL.
>   Some people may think "Oh it's Folsom version?".
>   No worries, Redhat has already started the planning to
>   upgrade it to Grizzly!
>   
>    The cluster has only 20 machines, so please use it kindly :)
>   There are already 4713 members of the TryStack Facebook group, and
>   3627 requests to join.
>   So if all of users start boot vm at same time, the cluster may get upset.
>   We will check the status of the cluster, gradually adding new users
>   for the clusters.
>   
>    Best.
